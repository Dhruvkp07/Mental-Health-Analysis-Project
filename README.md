# Mental-Health-Analysis-Project
This dataset represents synthetic daily mental health and lifestyle data for general working individuals. It captures realistic patterns of sleep, screen time, exercise, work load, and social interactions that affect mood, stress, and overall productivity.

Each record corresponds to a single day for a hypothetical worker, with features including:

Sleep Hours 🛌 – total hours slept
Screen Time 📱 – daily time spent on digital devices
Exercise Minutes 🏃‍♂️ – physical activity per day
Daily Pending Tasks 📋 – unfinished work items or responsibilities
Interruptions 🔔 – number of daily interruptions
Fatigue Level 😴 – subjective fatigue rating
Social Hours 🗣️ – time spent interacting with family, friends, or coworkers
Coffee Cups ☕ – caffeine intake
Diet Quality 🍎 – categorical rating of meals: poor, average, or good
Weather 🌤️ – categorical: sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy
Mood Score 😀😟 – daily mood rating (1–10)
Stress Level 😰 – daily stress rating (1–10)
Use Cases:

Predicting daily mood or stress levels based on lifestyle factors
Feature importance and correlation analysis
Experimenting with machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting
Time-series extension if multi-day data per worker is simulated
Fun Insights You Can Explore:

How screen time vs. sleep affects mood
Impact of exercise and social interaction on stress levels
Coffee intake ☕ and interruptions 🔔 as subtle stress contributors
This dataset is perfect for educators, ML enthusiasts, or data storytellers looking to practice about mental health and lifestyle.
